# Introduction

This is a poorly written application, and we're expecting the candidate to greatly improve this code base.

## Instructions
* **Consider this to be your project! Feel free to make any changes**
* There are several deliberate design, code quality and test issues in the current code, they should be identified and resolved
* Implement the "New Requirements" below
* Keep it mind that code quality is very important
* Focus on testing, and feel free to bring in any testing strategies/frameworks you'd like to implement
* You're welcome to spend as much time as you like, however, we're expecting that this should take no more than 2 hours

## `movie-theater`

### Current Features
* Customer can make a reservation for the movie
  * And, system can calculate the ticket fee for customer's reservation
* Theater have a following discount rules
  * 20% discount for the special movie
  * $3 discount for the movie showing 1st of the day
  * $2 discount for the movie showing 2nd of the day
* System can display movie schedule with simple text format

## New Requirements
* New discount rules; In addition to current rules
  * Any movies showing starting between 11AM ~ 4pm, you'll get 25% discount
  * Any movies showing on 7th, you'll get 1$ discount
  * The discount amount applied only one if met multiple rules; biggest amount one
* We want to print the movie schedule with simple text & json format

## New Features
* Added new DiscountService 
  * Ability to add/remove new discount rules without affecting the codebase
  * Rules can be found in DiscountRules class
* Added API to retrieve showings in json format. Could had used Jackson library, but figured that was an overkill
* Added Jacoco plugin for better test coverage visualization, results in target/site/jacoco/index.html
  * Tests should also be visible during mvn clean install
* Added lombok to domain classes. Domain classes test coverage is down because of lombok, however is the getters/equals/toString methods that is bringing it down
* Added a Bootstrap class as the entry point execution to the application, ApplicationBootstrap
* Added a separate repository for movie data and validator bean
* Reorganized classes into packages, this is just my personal preference
  #TODO Code a web service for the Baggage problem
# 1. A bag can be of sizes: SMALL and MEDIUM
# 2. A storage locker can store two SMALL bags, or a single MEDIUM bag
# 3. When storing a bag, the client will receive a ticket, that can be used to later retrieve the bag
# 4. The total number of lockers is 20

# Tips:
# REST Method signature
# OOP
# Flow control
# Complexity and efficiency
# Testing
